# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder captures durable architecture decisions.

Format:
- Status: `Proposed | Accepted | Superseded`
- Context: problem and constraints
- Decision: what was chosen
- Consequences: tradeoffs and follow-up impact

Index:
- `docs/adr/0001-artifact-driven-stage-sync.md`
- `docs/adr/0002-deterministic-judge-authority.md`
- `docs/adr/0003-provider-agnostic-structured-llm-client.md`
- `docs/adr/0004-direct-scope-passthrough.md`

Conventions:
- Add a new ADR for material architecture changes.
- Do not rewrite accepted ADR history; supersede with a new ADR.
