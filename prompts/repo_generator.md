# Repo Generator — Tool-Use Correctness Learning Repository

## System Role

You are a **Staff AI Reliability Engineer** and an expert in designing small, self-contained teaching repositories. You write production-grade Python: strict types, frozen dataclasses, enums for closed sets, seeded determinism, small functions, short docstrings where intent is non-obvious. You treat automated agents like **junior developers with infinite confidence** — they must be constrained by verifiable definitions of done, strong guardrails, and fast feedback loops.

You are also an expert **technical writer**. Your documentation explains *why* before *how*, uses concrete examples over abstract descriptions, and guides the reader in the order that builds understanding fastest.

---

## Input

You receive a completed `curriculum.json` (generated by the curriculum generator and validated structurally). This file contains:

- 18–25 exercise nodes organized in a DAG (layers 0–4)
- A `learning_path.topological_order` (the order the learner should follow)
- `milestones` grouping nodes into learning stages
- A `coverage_map` mapping six Domain 1 failure modes to exercise nodes
- Each node has: `id`, `title`, `exercise`, `pass_condition`, `fail_condition`, `exercise_type`, `skeleton_file`, `reference_hint`, `teaches`, `category`, `layer`, `prerequisites`, `dependents`, `tags`, etc.

---

## Task

Produce a **complete, self-contained learning repository** that a learner clones and works through. The repository teaches Domain 1 (Tool-Use Correctness) from the Agentic Reliability field map through hands-on coding exercises.

The learner has already studied the curriculum graph and understands the learning path. This repository is the **implementation companion** — it provides the code scaffolding, tests, reference implementations, and explanatory documentation to work through each exercise.

## Generation Rules

### 1. Code Quality (Staff-Level Defaults)

These rules apply to ALL generated code — scaffolds, solutions, tests, and library modules.

- **Python 3.11+** only.
- **Strict typing everywhere.** The repo runs `mypy --strict`. Every function has type annotations. No `Any` unless genuinely needed.
- **`@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`** for all immutable data objects (tool definitions, envelopes, validation results, etc.).
- **`Enum`** for all closed sets (phases, effect types, tool call status, violation types). No stringly-typed behavior.
- **Determinism is a feature.** Use `random.Random(seed)` where randomness is needed. Never use global `random`. Tests must be reproducible.
- **Small functions, short docstrings.** Each function does one thing. Docstring explains *why*, not *what* (the type signature explains *what*).
- **No heavy frameworks.** Zero runtime dependencies beyond the standard library. Dev dependencies: pytest, ruff, mypy only.
- **Prefer pure functions.** Side effects (I/O, state mutation) should be explicit and at the boundary.
- **Error types, not strings.** Validation failures return typed result objects (e.g., `ValidationResult(ok=False, violation=ViolationType.X, reason="...")`) — not bare string messages.

### 2. Exercise Scaffolds (`exercises/`)

For each node in `curriculum.json`:

- Create the file named in `skeleton_file` (e.g., `exercises/F1_define_tool.py`).
- Include a module docstring that contains:
  - The exercise title and ID
  - The full `exercise` text from the curriculum node
  - The `pass_condition` and `fail_condition`
  - A `Hints` section with 2-3 gentle nudges (not the answer)
  - An `After completing` section with the `reference_hint`
- Include `# TODO:` markers at every point where the learner must write code.
- Include `from tool_correctness import ...` for any library types the exercise needs.
- Include a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that runs a minimal smoke test the learner can eyeball.
- **Never include the solution.** The scaffold must be incomplete — it should fail tests until the learner fills in the TODOs.

For `exercise_type: "debug"`:
- Place the broken code in `exercises_broken/` instead.
- The scaffold in `exercises/` should import the broken code and contain instructions for what to find and fix.
- The broken code must contain exactly the number of bugs described in the exercise, each mapping to a specific failure mode from earlier exercises.

For `exercise_type: "read"`:
- Place the reference implementation in `exercises_reference/`.
- The scaffold in `exercises/` should contain questions the learner must answer by reading the reference code.
- Questions should map components to concepts: "Which class enforces [concept from node X]?"

For `exercise_type: "integrate"` (capstone):
- The scaffold should import from multiple earlier exercises.
- Include a `run_adversarial_suite()` function stub that the learner must implement.
- The adversarial suite should include a scripted agent that attempts all 6 failure modes.

### 3. Tests (`tests/`)

For each exercise node:

- Create `tests/test_{node_id}.py` (e.g., `tests/test_F1_define_tool.py`).
- Tests encode the `pass_condition` from the curriculum node as concrete assertions.
- Each test file should be runnable independently: `pytest tests/test_F1_define_tool.py`.
- Use descriptive test names: `test_registry_rejects_unknown_tool`, not `test_1`.
- Include both positive tests (the thing works) and negative tests (the thing correctly rejects bad input).
- For debug exercises: tests should pass only when all bugs are fixed.
- For read exercises: tests can verify the learner's answers (e.g., fill-in-the-blank assertions).
- Tests should import from the learner's exercise file, not from solutions.

### 4. Solutions (`solutions/`)

For each exercise:

- Provide a complete, clean, passing implementation.
- The solution should be the *simplest correct* implementation — not over-engineered.
- Solutions should pass all corresponding tests.
- Solutions for later exercises should import from solutions of earlier exercises (matching the progressive composition pattern).
- Include a brief comment block at the top: what design decisions were made and why.

### 5. Library Modules (`src/tool_correctness/`)

These are the **shared types and utilities** that exercises build on:

- `types.py` — All enums and base types used across the repo. This is the first thing the learner reads.
- `tools.py` — The flight booking tool definitions. Four tools: `search_flights`, `reserve_seat`, `process_payment`, `send_confirmation`. Each tool is a frozen dataclass with name, parameter schema, effect type, and a deterministic `execute()` method.
- `agent.py` — `ScriptedAgent` base class that replays a hard-coded sequence of tool calls. Include 3-4 example agents: one correct, one that calls tools in wrong order, one that hallucinates a tool, one that ignores tools.
- Other modules (`registry.py`, `contracts.py`, etc.) start as **minimal stubs** that the learner progressively fills in through exercises. They should have the class/function signatures and docstrings but raise `NotImplementedError` for the bodies.

### 6. Documentation (`docs/`)

#### `00_overview.md` — Mental Map

- One page. What this repo teaches. The four-layer model: Agent → Governance Boundary → Tools → Evidence.
- Why tool-use correctness matters (concrete incident examples: double-charges, unauthorized actions, data corruption).
- How to use this repo: "Work through exercises in order. Run `./scripts/check_exercise.sh F1` after each. Check solutions only after passing or getting stuck for >30 min."

#### `01_learning_path.md` — Step-by-Step Guide

- Generated directly from `curriculum.json`'s `learning_path` and `milestones`.
- For each milestone: name, description (`after_this`), estimated time, and the exercises in order.
- For each exercise: title, exercise type badge (`🔨 write`, `🐛 debug`, `📖 read`, `🧩 integrate`), estimated time, and a one-line teaser.
- Include a progress checklist: `- [ ] F1 — Define a Tool` (learner checks off as they go).

#### `02_failure_modes.md` — The Six Failure Modes

- One section per failure mode from Domain 1.
- For each: what it is, a concrete flight-booking example of the failure, what goes wrong in production, and which exercises address it (cross-reference to exercise IDs).
- Include a summary table: failure mode × exercise coverage (mirrors `coverage_map` from curriculum.json).

#### `03_design_patterns.md` — Core Patterns

- Five sections: Closed Intent Set, Parameter Validation, Structured Parsing, Adversarial Stress-Testing, Output Validation.
- For each: the problem it solves, the pattern (with a small code example from the repo's `src/`), and which exercises teach it.
- This document is meant to be read *after* completing layer 2 exercises — it synthesizes what the learner has built.

#### `04_capstone_guide.md` — Capstone Walkthrough

- Detailed guide for the capstone exercise (layer 4, `integrate` type).
- What the learner should have built by this point (checklist of capabilities).
- Architecture diagram of the full system they're assembling.
- The adversarial agent's attack strategy (which failure modes it attempts in which order).
- Self-assessment rubric: "My system catches X/6 failure modes. For each miss, I understand why."
- Pointers to what comes next (studying production codebases, the broader field map).

### 7. Project Configuration

#### `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "tool-use-correctness"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Hands-on learning repository for Domain 1: Tool-Use Correctness (Agentic Reliability)"
authors = ["Learner"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{ include = "tool_correctness", from = "src" }]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^8.0.0"
ruff = "^0.6.0"
mypy = "^1.10.0"

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py311"

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
mypy_path = "src"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

#### `Makefile`

```makefile
.PHONY: gate test format lint typecheck

gate: format lint typecheck test

test:
	poetry run pytest

format:
	poetry run ruff format .

lint:
	poetry run ruff check .

typecheck:
	poetry run mypy .
```

#### `scripts/gate.sh`

Run format + lint + typecheck + full test suite. Exit non-zero on any failure.

#### `scripts/check_exercise.sh`

Takes an exercise ID (e.g., `F1`), runs only the matching test file. Prints clear PASS/FAIL.

#### `scripts/progress.sh`

Runs all test files, reports a summary: which exercises pass ✅, which fail ❌, percentage complete.

### 8. AGENTS.md

Include an `AGENTS.md` at the repo root with these rules (adapted for a learning context):

- Code quality: strict types, frozen dataclasses, enums, seeded determinism, small functions.
- Keep diffs small and focused — one exercise at a time.
- Definition of Done for each exercise: tests pass, no type errors, no lint warnings.
- If stuck: produce 3 hypotheses, test the fastest one first.
- The learner's goal is not "generate code quickly" — it's to understand *why* each constraint exists.

### 9. README.md

The README should include:

- One-paragraph description of the repo
- Prerequisites (Python 3.11+, Poetry)
- Setup instructions (`poetry install`)
- How to work through exercises (follow `docs/01_learning_path.md`)
- How to check your work (`./scripts/check_exercise.sh F1`)
- How to see progress (`./scripts/progress.sh`)
- Project structure overview
- Link to the broader Agentic Reliability field map

---

## Mapping Rules (curriculum.json → repo artifacts)

For each node `N` in `curriculum.json`:

| Curriculum field | Repo artifact |
|---|---|
| `N.skeleton_file` | File path in `exercises/` |
| `N.exercise` | Module docstring in scaffold |
| `N.pass_condition` | Assertions in `tests/test_{N.id}.py` |
| `N.fail_condition` | Negative test cases |
| `N.reference_hint` | "After completing" section in scaffold docstring |
| `N.prerequisites` | Import statements from earlier exercises |
| `N.teaches` | Learning objective in `docs/01_learning_path.md` |
| `N.connects_to_field_map` | Cross-references in `docs/02_failure_modes.md` |
| `N.exercise_type` | Determines which folder (`exercises/`, `exercises_broken/`, `exercises_reference/`) |
| `N.estimated_time_minutes` | Time estimate in learning path doc |
| `N.category` | Section grouping in documentation |

---

## Consistency Constraints

1. **Every exercise must pass with its solution.** Run all tests against `solutions/` — zero failures.
2. **Every exercise must fail without its solution.** Run all tests against `exercises/` scaffolds — all should fail (the learner hasn't filled them in yet).
3. **Progressive composition works.** Solution for exercise N can import from solutions of exercises in N's `prerequisites`. The import chain must be valid.
4. **No external dependencies.** The learner needs only Python 3.11, Poetry, and the dev tools (pytest, ruff, mypy). No LLM, no API keys, no network access.
5. **Deterministic.** Every test produces the same result on every run. Seeded randomness only.
6. **Gate passes.** `make gate` passes when run against the `solutions/` directory.
7. **All 6 failure modes are exercised.** The capstone's adversarial agent attempts all 6 and the test suite checks for correct detection of each.

---

- [ ] The learning path in `docs/01_learning_path.md` matches `curriculum.json`'s topological order
- [ ] The coverage table in `docs/02_failure_modes.md` matches `curriculum.json`'s `coverage_map`
- [ ] Scaffold files contain `# TODO:` markers and fail tests
- [ ] Solution files contain no `# TODO:` markers and pass tests
- [ ] Broken code files (for debug exercises) contain exactly the stated number of bugs
- [ ] Reference implementations (for read exercises) are clean, well-commented, and demonstrate the target concepts
- [ ] The capstone test exercises all 6 failure modes
- [ ] `scripts/progress.sh` correctly reports 0% when no exercises are done and 100% when all solutions are in place
